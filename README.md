==============================
(Note: We didn't remember about the required readme on time. Sorry about that.)

  Using the game is pretty simple, as it plays exactly the same as the popular board game Connect 4. Each turn, a player must select a column from 1 to 7. If that column is not full, a red or black tile will be dropped into the lowest open slot in that column. One player drops red tiles, the other black ones. The first player to get four tiles of their color in a row diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, into the board wins.
  
  To play a tile, simply select one of the seven buttons at the bottom, one beneath each column labeled one through seven. The button in the upper right hand corner of the screen, labeled "Toggle Singleplayer" allows the player to switch between a two player game and playing against a (very) easy Ai, a medium one, and a hard one. The easy and medium settings are based on earlier versions of the ai. Once you set the ai's difficulty, it will play after each of your moves. When the game is over, simply quit or hit the reset button in the upper left hand corner.
